Note 13 — Segment Information
We have seven industry-based operating segments, which are aggregated into four reportable business segments: 
• Financial Services, which consists of the banking and insurance operating segments;
• Health Sciences, which consists of a single operating segment of the same name;
• Products and Resources, which consists of the retail and consumer goods; manufacturing, logistics, energy, and 
utilities; and travel and hospitality operating segments; and
• Communications, Media and Technology, which consists of a single operating segment of the same name.
Our segments are industry-based, and as such, we report revenue from clients in the segment with which our clients are 
most closely aligned. Our client partners, account executives and client relationship managers are aligned in accordance with 
the specific industries they serve. Our CODM evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on segment 
revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. 
Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, 
pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by the operating segments 
may affect revenues and operating expenses to differing degrees. 
Corporate expenses, expenses related to our NextGen program, a portion of depreciation and amortization and the impact 
of the settlements of the cash flow hedges are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the 
CODM. Accordingly, such expenses are excluded from segment operating profit and are included below as “unallocated costs” 
and adjusted against our total income from operations. Additionally, we do not disclose assets by segment as a significant 
portion of the assets is used interchangeably among the segments and the CODM does not review such information.
For revenues by reportable segment and geographic area, see Note 2.
